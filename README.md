**Tea Timer**
A simple desktop application built with Python's Tkinter library. 
The app helps you brew the perfect cup of tea by offering a selection of tea types, displaying recommended steeping times and boiling temperatures, and providing a built-in countdown timer. 
It also is planned to support a dark theme to ensure that the interface remains clear and readable in low-light environments.

**Features**
Tea Selection: Choose your preferred tea type from a drop-down list.
Brew Recommendations: View recommended steeping times and boiling temperatures for each tea.
Countdown Timer: A built-in timer that counts down from the recommended steeping time.
Dark Theme Support: Custom styling ensures that the app remains readable on dark backgrounds.
Customizable: Easily add more tea types or modify the existing settings by updating the tea_data dictionary.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Tkinter: Python's standard GUI toolkit for building desktop applications.

**Installation**
Clone or Download the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/teatimer.git
cd teatimer
(Replace the URL with the actual repository URL if applicable.)

Ensure Python is Installed: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can check your Python version with:

bash
Copy
python --version
No Additional Dependencies Needed: The application uses Python's built-in Tkinter library. If you're on a system where Tkinter is not installed, refer to your operating system's instructions to install it.

Usage
Run the Application:
bash
Copy
python teatimer.py
Using the App:
Select a Tea Type: Use the drop-down menu to choose your tea (e.g., "Most black tea" or "Green tea").
View Recommendations: The app will display the recommended steeping time and boiling temperature.
Set Timer: You can use the pre-populated timer value or enter your own time in seconds.
Start Timer: Click the "Start Timer" button to begin the countdown.
Enjoy Your Tea: Once the timer reaches zero, the app will notify you that your tea is ready.
Customization
Adding More Teas: To add a new tea type, update the tea_data dictionary in the teatimer.py file with the tea's boiling temperature, recommended steeping time range, and a default timer value (in seconds). For example:

python
Copy
tea_data = {
    "Most black tea": {
        "boiling_temp": 100,
        "steeping_time_range": "3–5 minutes",
        "default_time": 180
    },
    "Green tea": {
        "boiling_temp": 80,
        "steeping_time_range": "2–3 minutes",
        "default_time": 120
    },
    "Herbal tea": {
        "boiling_temp": 95,
        "steeping_time_range": "5–7 minutes",
        "default_time": 300
    }
}
Modifying the Dark Theme: The styling for the dark theme is set using the Tkinter ttk.Style configuration. You can adjust the colors and fonts as needed:

python
Copy
style.configure("TFrame", background="#333333")
style.configure("TLabel", background="#333333", foreground="white")
style.configure("TButton", background="#444444", foreground="white")
style.configure("TEntry", fieldbackground="#444444", foreground="white")
